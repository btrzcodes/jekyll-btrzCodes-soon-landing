Not-That-Junior Backend Developer.


## What's on my BackPack?

Well, I was journalist eons ago so curiosity and the wanna-share-this-incredible-thing feeling are still there. **I used to interview people, now I interview machines**.  

I massive recycled my profesional profile **during 4 years** as a Backend Developer inside a brand studio's tech team, after have studied a one-year graphic design and old-school-front-end master degree.

As soon as I started that job I thrilling was prompted by Wordpress queries, Javascript data management, PHP power, Shell wizardish commands, MySQL fresh-fountain-data, Nginx and Apache misterious configs and, for the last year there, the Node API world. Through this years **I discovered the inner Backend in me, the wonderful astract order to be discoveded at the server-side**.

As I wanted to grow more as a Node Dev, this year I started working at a fintech, developing its Node API in a high-efficent backend team.

**Now I am on my way to become a Mid-Senior**. One of those who helps teams flowing, that teaches as much as learns from their coding-mates.
