# Hi there!

Not-That-Junior Backend Developer.


## What's on my BackPack?

Well, I used to be a journalist years ago. But that was another life although curiosity and the wanna-share-this-incredible-thing feeling are still there. **I used to interview people, now I interview machines**.  

I massive recicled my profesional profile **During 4 years** as a Backend Developer at a brand studio TIC team, after studing a year graphic design and old-school-front-end course.

As soon as I started that job I thrilling was prompted by Wordpress queries, Javascript data management, PHP power, shell wizardish commands, MySQL fresh-fountain-data, Nginx and Apache configs and, for the last year there, the Node API world. Through this years **I discovered the inner Backend in me, the wonderful astract order to be discoveded at the server-side**.

As I wanted to grow more as a Pro Node Dev, this year I started working at a fintech, developing its Node API in a high-efficent backend team.

**Now I am on my way to became a Senior**. One of this who helps teams flow, and teaches and learn at the same level.
